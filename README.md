# STAFF_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM

Introducing our innovative online staff management system for the OOP project at SLIIT. This web application simplifies office staff management by providing a handy online platform. Attendance monitoring, record-keeping, and a complete personnel database simplify administrative work. The user-friendly interface lets staff request leave, see their leave history, and provide feedback through the user-friendly interface. Administrators may manage personnel, update salary details, view user profiles, leave applications, and provide feedback. Our online staff management system is revolutionising the way offices handle their workforce.
